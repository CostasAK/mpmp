## Transcription

$$
D_0 = 3 A_0 \\
\Delta = A_0 - D_0 \\
A_1 = 3 D_0 \\
D_1 = \frac{1}{2} A_1 \\
A_2 = D_1 + \Delta \\
\Delta = A_2 - D_1 \\
D_2 = 3 A_2 \\
A_3 + D_2 = 65 \\
\Delta = A_3 - D_2 \\
D_2 ?
$$

Additional constraints:

$$
A_2 < A_3 < 65 \\
D_1 < D_2 < 65 \\
A_1 > A_3 \\
D_0 < D_2 < 65 \newline
A_0 < A_3 < 65
$$

## Solution

$$
2 D_2 + \Delta = 65 \\\\
6 A_2 + \Delta = 65 \\
6 D_1 + 7 \Delta = 65 \\
3 A_1 + 7 \Delta = 65 \\
9 D_0 + 7 \Delta = 65 \\
27 A_0 + 7 \Delta = 65 \\
34 A_0 - 7 D_0 = 65 \\
13 A_0 = 65 \\
A_0 = 5 \\
D_0 = 15 \\
\Delta = 10 \\
A_1 = 45 \\
D_1 = 22\cfrac{1}{2} \\
A_2 = 12\cfrac{1}{2} \\
D_2 = 37\cfrac{1}{2}
$$

Anton is **37Â½** years old.
